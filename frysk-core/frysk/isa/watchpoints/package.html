This package implements Frysk's Low level Watchpoint abstraction. This package is 
concerned with setting watchpoints: setting the watchpoint register and then
setting the control bit in the debug control register for that watchpoint.

Catching watchpoint triggering is dealt with elsewhere, namely in the 
Frysk task state-machine.
