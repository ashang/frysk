This package implements a representation of target signals.

<h2>Overview</h2>

When interacting with a target process two sets of signals are involved:

<ul>
<li>the host's signals
<li>the target's signals
</ul>

When controlling a native process the two are identical; however when
examining non-native core files or controlling remote processes the
two can be different.

<p>

This package provides an abstraction of the target's signal set.
