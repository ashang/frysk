This package implements a command line interpreter modeled after the
High Performance Debugger Forum's interface.

<h2>BUILDING</h2>
<ul>
<li>To build a recursive automake is used, located in src/jline. The invocation of the Makefile.am is specified through
the main Makefile.am and configure.ac, grep those for "jline" if you want to make changes.
<li>The current version has references to native windows code removed in Terminal.java and WindowsTermnial.java removed
entirely.
<li>Changed obsolete java code in ConsoleReader:692 to code that doesn't give warnings, but supposedly that throws an
exception on OS X.
</ul>

<h2>Command line handling:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Command has to get preprocessed at first using Preprocessor, what
this does is handle multiline and ';' combined commands.
</ul>
