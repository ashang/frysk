Description of the FRYSK Event Loop.

<h2>Overview</h2>

The FRYSK event-loop, in conjunction with {@link frysk.sys}, provide a
set of event driven interface to the linux kernel.  The event-loop
directly handles the following events:

<p>

<ul>
<li>timeouts and count-down timers
<li>signals
<li>file descriptors
</ul>

<p>

Each is discussed below.

<h2>Timeouts and Count-Down Timers</h2>

The event loop provides both once-only, and repeating timers.  See
{@link frysk.event.TimerEvent} for more information.

<h2>Signals</h2>

The event loop provides signal event notifiers.  Note that a signal
event is delivered outside of the signal handler.  See {@link
frysk.event.SignalEvent} for more information.

<h2>File Descriptors</h2>

The event loop provides file descriptor event notifiers.  See {@link
frysk.event.PollEvent} for more information.

<h2>Process (wait) Events</h2>

By binding calls to {@link frysk.sys.Wait.waitNoHang} to the {@link
frysk.sys.Sig#CHLD} signal using a {@link frysk.event.SignalEvent},
<code>wait</code> events can be processed by the event-loop.

<h2>Event Starvation</h2>

Event Starvation occurs when a single constantly re-occurring event is
dispatched in preference to other events.  The frysk event-loop
addresses this by processing events using two distinct phases:

<ul>
<li>accumulation of pending events
<li>dispatch of pending events
</ul>

<br>
Doing this ensures that all existing pending events are processed
before any new events are scheduled.
