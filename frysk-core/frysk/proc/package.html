This package implements FRYSK's process model of the target system.

<h2>Overview</h2>

FRYSK's process model provides a process-level view of the target
system.  The model consists of hosts (<code>Host</code>), processes
(<code>Proc</code>), and tasks (<code>Task</code>, a.k.a., threads).
Frysk provides both behavioral and relational views of that model.

<p>

The following sections describe each of those views.

<h2>Relational View: A Process Tree</h2>

Consistent with the underlying linux system, FRYSK's process model can
be viewed as a collection of hosts, each host having a tree of
processes:

<p>

Process 1 forms the root of the process tree.

<p>

The tasks, within a process, form a simple two level tree:

<p>

Methods for iterating over, and searching for, a host's process and
tasks are provided.

<h2>Behavioral View: Message Passing State Machines</h2>

<p>

The process model can also be viewed as a collection of independent
state-machines.  Each state-machine instance tracks the state of the
corresponding host, process, or task.

<p>

For instance, a process(or {@link frysk.proc.Proc} object) has the
following states:

<p>

The client manipulates a state-machine instance by sending it request
messages.  The state-machine, in turn, notifies interested client of
state transitions that result from these requests, and other
asynchronous events, using observers.

<p>

Finally, the individual state-machine uses internal messages to
co-ordinate the systems overall state.
