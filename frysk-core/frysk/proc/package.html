This documents frysk's process model of the target system.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

FRYSK's process model provides a process view of the target system.
That system consisting of hosts (<code>Host</code>), processes
(<code>Proc</code>) and light weight processes (<code>Task</code>).
Frysk provides behavioral and relational views of that model.  The
following sections describe each of those views.
