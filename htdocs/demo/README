monitor/debugger.  Here are a list of the other files in this directory:

	frysk_demo.pdf - A Frysk script for setting up and demoing Frysk.
	
	looper.c - A demo program that loops forever.  Needed to demo the
			source window part of Frysk.

The frysk_demo.pdf describes in detail how to setup and demonstrate Frysk.
Instructions on which screens to bring up and what the fields on each
screen mean.  The demo walks a user through:
	
	- Setting up a "debug session" with observers
	- Showing the monitoring window in action
	- Bringing up a source/register/memory window
