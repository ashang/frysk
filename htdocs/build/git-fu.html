<em>frysk</em> is changing from CVS
to <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">Git</a>
for its source control system. This page is meant to ease the
transition for new Git users and point the way towards the more
advanced usage that motivated the switch in the first place.</p>

<a name="resources"><h2>Git Resources</h2></a>

<p>
The Git manual pages can be a bit opaque, but there are several good
sources of information about Git on the Web.

</ul>
</p>

<a name="concepts"><h2>Git Concepts for CVS Refugees</h2></a>

<p>
You can use Git in a similar way to CVS and ignore many of its features, but if
you know a little background information about Git and its repository structure
you will be able to start doing more advanced operations and get out of trouble
if you mess something
up. This
 <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#git-concepts">chapter</a>
in the Git manual tells the whole story, but a quick introduction will get you
 started.</p>
<p>
The Git repository stores the history of a project as a chain of revisions
which describe changes (file and directory additions, deletions, and
modifications) to the project's source tree. These revisions, called <em>commit
objects,</em> are named by an SHA1 hash over the contents of the commit, the
date and author, and the SHA1 hashes of the commit's parents. It is important
to note that two commits, whose contents (diff) are identical and that were
based on identical "snapshots" of the source tree, will have different SHA1
names if the history that preceeded them is different.</p>
<p>
When you start work on a project that is in a remote git repository,
you <em>clone</em> that repository; that is, you copy all the commit objects to
your machine. The "checked out" copy of the sources where you do your work is
called the <em>working tree.</em> As you work on the project you create new
commit objects with
your changes. You update the remote repository by publishing your new commit
objects to it. One way to publish is by emailing your new commit objects to a
centeral maintainer (e.g., Linus) who either commits them to the remote
repository, rejects them, or hacks on them locally and then commits new
ones. In the <em>frysk</em> project we allow developers to have write
access to the remote repository and publish the commits themselves.</p>
<p>
The chain of commits is actually a directed acyclic graph, supporting branches
of development. A commit object can have multiple children at a branch point;
similarly, a commit can have multiple parents where branches merge back
together. In Git a <em>branch name</em> is not much more than a nickname for
the commit object on the end of a chain of commit objects.</p>
<p>
A Git repository contains other auxiliary data structures to speed up common
operations. The most important one is the <em>index,</em> which supports very
fast diff operations over the entire tree. When you create a new commit, you
first have to update the index with the content of the new commit. In CVS you
have to <tt>cvs add</tt> new files, but not new changes; in Git you have
to <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-add.html"><tt>git-add</tt></a> every change, including file modifications. In practice you
don't have to deal with it that much because the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html"><tt>git-commit</tt></a> command
has a flag to automatically add changed files to the index before a commit,
though you do need to explicitly add new files. Also, when the Git commands
that do merges fail because of a conflict, they put conflict markers in the
offending files and exit. After editing the files and resolving the conflict,
you signal that the conflict is resolved by adding the changes to the
index. You can then restart the merge command and continue.</p>

<a name="gitversion"><h2>Git Version</h2></a>
<p>
Version 1.5.2.2 of Git is currently available in <tt>yum</tt> for Fedora Core
6, but it is recommended that you download 1.5.3.2 or later
from <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/">kernel.org.</a></p>

<a name="repository"><h2>The <em>frysk</em> Git Repository</h2></a>
<p>
You can see a view of the <em>frysk</em> Git
repository <a href="http://sourceware.org/git/?p=frysk.git;a=summary">here.</a>
Like most Git repositories, It contains a branch called <tt>master</tt> which
is the official "mainline" of development. It also has a branch
called <tt>cvs-sync</tt> which is updated semi-automatically from CVS
checkins. When we switch over from CVS to Git for real the <tt>cvs-sync</tt>
branch will stay frozen at the last commit derived from CVS. Developers are
encouraged to create their own branches for learning Git and for publishing
long-lived lines of development that aren't ready for <tt>master.</tt></p>

<a name="gettingstarted"><h2>Getting Started</h2></a>
<p>
Let's start hacking. Clone the repository with <pre>
    git-clone ssh://sources.redhat.com/git/frysk.git</pre></p>

<p>If you're not a <em>frysk</em> developer, you can use the
URL <tt>git://sources.redhat.com/git/frysk.git</tt> instead.</p>
<p>
In the <tt>frysk</tt> subdirectory you will find a checked-out <em>frysk</em>
tree. The Git repository is in the hidden directory <tt>.git.</tt> What state
are we in?
<pre>
$ git-status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)</pre></p>
<p>
The <tt><a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitk.html">gitk</a> --all</tt> command is useful for getting a graphic representation
of the branch and history structure of the repository. Using it we see that
our <tt>master</tt> branch is branched from <tt>remotes/origin/master</tt>,
which is a remote branch. We have a copy all the commit objects from that
remote branch in our repository and we get fetch updates to it, but we can
never switch to a remote branch and make actual changes there.</p>
<p>
Make some changes and commit them locally:
<pre>
$ edit newfile.java <b>(1)</b>
$ edit ChangeLog <b>(2)</b>
$ git-add newfile.java <b>(3)</b>
$ git-commit -a <b>(4></b>
$ git-pull origin <b>(5)</b>
$ git-push origin <b>(6)</b>
</pre></p>
<ol>
  <li><p>create a new file</p>
  <li><p>edit an existing file</p>
  <li><p>add the new file to the index</p>
  <li><p>commit the changes. The <tt>-a</tt> option to <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html"><tt>git-commit</tt></a>
  causes it to add the changes to <tt>ChangeLog</tt> to the index.</p>
  <li><p>update our repository with any changes from the remote repository.</p>
  <li><p>push our changes to the remote repository.</p>
</ol>
<p>
In step <b>5</b> we could have gotten a merge conflict if we had touched files
that had been updated in the remote repository. In that case we would look for
the conflict markers (like in CVS), edit them, add our changes with 
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-add.html"><tt>git-add</tt></a>, and make a commit with <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit..html"><tt>git-commit.</tt></a>Git will fashion a
special merge commit for us.</p>
<p>
In step <b>6</b> the push would have failed if our copy of the <tt>master</tt>
branch wasn't up to date with the remote branch. In that case we would have
done a <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html"><tt>git-pull</tt></a>, resolved any merge conflicts, and tried again.</p>

<a name="branches"><h2>Branches and Rebasing</h2></a>
<p>
In the above example we made changes directly to the <tt>master</tt> branch,
but it's generally desirable to create a local branch for all but the most
trivial changes. In this way you can work on several bug fixes and other
development at once. Also, in the above example, if there had been a conflict
at the pull step, our merge commit would have been pushed to the remote
repository where it would be an ugly distraction. By doing work in a local
branch and then rebasing that onto the current upstream state we can commit a
very clean series of commits to the upstream repository.</p>
<p>First, let's make our change on the <tt>master</tt> branch and rebase that
  onto the remote branch:
<pre>
$ edit frysk-core/frysk/hpd/BreakpointCommand.java 
$ git-commit -a <b>(1)</b>
$ git-fetch origin <b>(2)</b>
$ git-rebase origin <b>(3)</b>
$ git-push origin
</pre></p>
<ol>
  <li><p>commit changes to <tt>master</tt> branch</p>
  <li><p>fetch updates from the remote repository without updating local branches</p>
  <li><p>Rewind this branch to the branch point, merge in updates from the
  remote repository, and then replay the new commits on top of that</p>
</ol>

<p>Here is the same work, done on a branch:
<pre>
$ git-branch topic/fixbreakpoints master<b>(1)</b>
$ git-checkout topic/fixbreakpoints<b>(2)</b>
$ edit frysk-core/frysk/hpd/BreakpointCommand.java
$ git-commit -a
$ git-checkout master<b>(3)</b>
$ git-pull origin
$ git-rebase master topic/fixbreakpoints<b>(4)</b>
$ git-checkout master<b>(5)</b>
$ git-merge topic/fixbreakpoints<b>(6)</b>
$ git-push orign
</pre></p>
<ol>
  <li><p>create a new branch from the head of <tt>master</tt>. You can use a
  path-like syntax in the branch names; it is common practice to put short
  lived local branches under the <tt>topic</tt> path.</p>
  <li><p>switch to the new branch. If you are creating a new branch from the head
  of an existing branch like we just did, you can do it all with 
<div><code>
      git checkout -b topic/fixbreakpoints master
      </code></div>
      </p>which creates a new branch and checks it out.</p>
<li><p>switch back to <tt>master</tt> and pull in updates</p>
<li><p>rebase the <tt>topic/fixbreakpoints</tt> branch onto the head
    of <tt>master.</tt> This checks out <tt>topic/fixbreakpoints.</tt></p>
<li><p>get back to <tt>master.</tt></p>
<li><p>merge changes from the topic branch to <tt>master.</tt> Because the
    topic branch is rooted at the current head of <tt>master,</tt> the merge
    can be done simply by changing the name <tt>master</tt> to point to the
    commit object at the head of the topic branch. This is a special kind of
    merge called a <em>fast forward merge</em> that is guaranteed not to cause
    any merge conflicts.</p>
  </ol>
<p>
When you switch from one branch to another you will lose uncommitted work. It's
customary to create a quick "work in progress" commit to save that work and then
undo it later to when continuing with that branch; see the "Interrupted
Workflow" example on the
 <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reset.html">
<tt>git-reset</tt></a> man page.. Git versions newer than 1.5.3 have a 
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-stash.html">
<tt>git-stash</tt></a> command that allows to to save uncommitted work when
changing branches without creating a commit..</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html"><tt>git-rebase</tt></a> is very powerful and can be used to graft chains of
commits from one branch to another. It is smart enough to recognize if a commit
in the branch being rebased already exists in the target branch and not cause a
conflict. However, you shouldn't rebase branches
whose head has been pushed to a public repository if you expect others to track
that branch. <tt>rebase</tt> changes the history in a way that screws up later
merges from the branch.</p>

<a name="names"><h2>Names</h2></a>
<p>
So far we have used branch names, but there many other ways to name interesting
commit objects:
<ul>
  <li><tt>HEAD</tt> is the name of the most recent object on the current branch
  <li><tt>^</tt> indicates the parent of an object. So <tt>HEAD^</tt> is the
  parent of the most recent commit object on this branch, and <tt>HEAD^^</tt>
  is its grandparent. If <tt>HEAD</tt> had several parents due to a merge, then
  they would be named <tt>HEAD^2</tt>, <tt>HEAD^3</tt>, etc.
  <li><tt>~</tt> is used to number previous generations of commits going
  through the first parent at each step. The direct ancestors of <tt>HEAD</tt>
  are <tt>HEAD~1</tt>, <tt>HEAD~2</tt>, <tt>HEAD~3</tt>, etc.
  <li>You can create new names for arbitrary commit objects using 
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html">
      <tt>git-tag</tt></a>.
  <li>A few magic names like <tt>ORIG_HEAD</tt> (set when merging to
  the <tt>HEAD</tt> before the merge) exist.
</ul>
See the documentation for
 <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rev-parse.html">
   <tt>git-rev-parse</tt></a> for the full story.</p>

<a name="reset"><h2>Backing Out Commits</h2></a>
<p>
You often need to "uncommit" commits, either because they were a bad idea, or
they need further work. There's local way that resets the names of local
branches and the indes, and a more formal way that creates the inverse of a
particular commit.</p>
<p>
To reset to two revisions back, blowing away all newer changes:
<pre>
$ git-reset --hard HEAD~2
</pre></p>
<p>
A more likely scenario is to undo a commit but leave the changes in your
working tree so you can work on them further. <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reset.html"><tt>git-reset</tt></a> with no
options does that:<pre>
$ git-reset HEAD^    
</pre></p>
<p>
You can collapse several commits on a branch into one commit
using <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reset.html"><tt>git-reset</tt></a> in this way.</p>
<p>
To create a commit that reverts another commit, and is suitable for pushing to
a public repository, use the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-revert.html"><tt>git-revert</tt></a> command.

<a name="diff"><h2>Examining History</h2></a>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html">
</tt>git-log</tt></a> prints out the commit log messages for an entire tree or
a specific file.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html"><tt>git-diff</tt></a> is used to examine differences between the working tree and
the index, as well as between arbitrary branches and commits. For example:<pre>
$ git-diff ChangeLog <b>1</b>
$ git-diff HEAD^..HEAD ChangeLog <b>2</b>
</pre></p>
<ol>
  <li><p>difference between <tt>ChangeLog</tt> in the working directory and the
  index</p>
  <li><p>differences in <tt>ChangeLog</tt> betwen the most recent revision and
      its predecessor.</p>
    </ol>

<a name="others"><h2>Other Git Commands</h2></a>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-cherry-pick.html">
<tt>git-cherry-pick</tt></a> picks a commit from anywhere and commits it to the
current branch.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-whatchanged.html">
<tt>git-whatchanged</tt></a> can, among other things, search for commits that
match a string or regular expression.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html">
  <tt>git-remote</tt></a> configures access to remote repositories and default
actions when pulling from and pushing to them. You would use this command to
track branches in repositories other than the one from which yours is
cloned.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html">
  <tt>git-bisect</tt></a> will do a binary search through the revision history
  to zero in on the first "bad" commit. At each stage you tell it whether its
  current choice is "good" or "bad" before it chooses the next.
