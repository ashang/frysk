<dt><strong> Is <em>frysk</em> Free? </strong></dt>

<dd>

Yes.

<br>

<em>frysk</em> is available under a "GPL + Exception" license.  You
can read the license on the <a
href="http://directory.fedora.redhat.com/wiki/GPL_Exception_License_Text">license
text</a> page or get more information on the <a

<dt><strong> What is an <cite>Execution Analysis Tool</cite>?
</strong></dt>

<dd>

With an <cite>Execution Analysis Tool</cite> the emphasis is on being
able to, examine, analyze, monitor, and visualize an application as it
continues to execute normally.

<br>

Of course, with <em>frysk</em>, operations to more directly control
and manipulate the application (such as start and stop threads, or
modify variables) are also available.

<dt><strong> How does <em>frysk</em> compare to other execution
analysis tools such as <tt>oprofile</tt>, and or <tt>systemtap</tt>

<dt><strong> How does <em>frysk</em> compare to a traditional command

<dd>

Here is a quick comparison table highlighting some of the differences:

<table border="1">

<tr valign="top"><th>traditional<th><em>frysk</em>

<tr valign="top">

<td>single thread; single process; single host

<td>multi-thread; multi-process; multi-host

<tr valign="top">

<td>stop the world: either the program is running, or the program is
stopped; there is no middle ground

<td>non-stop: threads, processes, and hosts can be monitored
individually or as a group; by default all are left running

<tr valign="top">

<td>explicit attach: the user must explicitly attach to, or start, a
process; and operations are strictly limited to the process currently
under the debuggers control

<td>always on: the user specifies the operation, <em>frysk</em>
handles the details (attaching if and when needed).

<tr valign="top">

<td>explicit control: the user must explicitly stop, start, or
otherwise control the program.

<td>event driven: the user specifies the events of interest (program
start, exec call, variable change, ...), <em>frysk</em> handles the
details

<tr valign="top">

<td>command line based

<td>graphical, visual

<tr valign="top">

<td>assume unoptimized C

<td>assume optimized, in-line, multi-threaded, object oriented, and
event driven, code

<tr valign="top">

<td>debug information loaded on demand, left on disk, or or on the
server

<tr valign="top">

event driven

<dt><strong> Will there be a scripting language? </strong></dt>

<dd>

Yes.

<br>

Since the <em>frysk</em> core is directly programmable, the addition
of a scripting language uch as Guile, Perl, or Python is more than
feasible.  In fact, there has already been multiple proposals to
directly integrate <tt>jpython</tt> into <em>frysk</em>.

<br>

As for which scripting language?  That choice is yours.

</dd>

<dt><strong> Will there be a command line interpreter? </strong></dt>

<dd>

Yes.

<br>

Since the <em>frysk</em> core is directly programmable, the addition
of a command line interpreter such as the High Performance Debugger
Forum Interface, or ADB is more than feasible.  In fact, the code base
already contains a skeleton of the HPD command line.

</dd>

<dt><strong> Will there be stand-alone utilities? </strong></dt>

<dd>

Yes.

<br>

<em>frysk</em>'s modular design makes possible the implementation of
stand-alone utilities including <tt>ftrace</tt>, and <tt>fstack</tt>.

</dd>

<dt><strong> Why is <em>frysk</em> written in Java? <br> Why not use the
systems programming language of choice, C? </strong></dt>

<dd>

<em>frysk</em> is principally written in native Java.  Where
performance is a significant factor, or where system interfaces are
involved, C++/CNI is been used.  This has a number of advantages:

<ul>

<li>

It gives developers, who are focused on the rapid development of
domain object models and graphical interfaces, access to a reasonably
modern, relatively small, object-oriented garbage collecting language

<li>

It avoids the quagmire that comes with fudging objects using a
procedural base language.

<li>

It provides a solid overlap between developers and users: software
engineers working on large, multi-thread, multi-process, object
oriented, distributed applications.<br>

<li>

It is 2005, not 1975.  Most modern applications are written in Java,
or C++, not C.

</ul>

<dd>

<dt><strong> Why use the Java-Gnome Toolkit? </strong></dt>

<dd>

Like anything, there is a trade off.  Below is a quick comparison
table highlighting some of the differences.  The requirement is for a
modern lightweight toolkit that provides a native look-and-feel, and
relies only on Free tools.

<table border="1">

<tr><td><th>Swing<th>SWT<th>Java-GNOME

<tr valign="top"><th>Pro:

<td>

<ul>
<li>Mostly JVM independent (but is the Free jvm complete)
</ul>

<td>

<ul>
<li>native look and feel, sort of
<li>some local knowledge
</ul>

<td>

<ul>
<li>modern toolkit
<li>some momentum
<li><tt>glade</tt> gui builder
<li><tt>dogtail</tt> gui tester
</ul>

<tr valign="top"><th>Con:

<td>

<ul>
<li>not native look-and-feel
<li>not really cross-platform
<li>is the Free implementation complete enough?
<li>Free gui builder?
<li>Free testing tool?
</li>

<td>

<ul>
<li>not true native look-and-feel
<li>somewhat messy
<li>Free gui builder?
<li>Free testing tool?
</ul>

<td>

<ul>
<li>under development (mature?)
</ul>

<dt><strong> Will <em>frysk</em> be integrated into Eclipse? </strong></em>

<dd>

Yes.

<br>

The <em>frysk</em> core is designed with direct and tight integration
into the Eclipse IDE in mind.  However, the more immediate need is to
provide users with a small, light weight, standalone, and graphical
tool that wraps around the <em>frysk</em> core.

</dd>

<dt><strong> Does <em>frysk</em> replace the traditional command line
debugger?  </strong></dt>

<dd>

No.

<br>

However, traditional debugger users, when they take on more
challenging tasks such as analyzing larger and more complex
applications, will likely find the opportunity to use <em>frysk</em>
very attractive.
