Below is a work-in-progress snapshot of a process view.

<pr>

A user is in the process of adding an observer to the <tt>exec</tt>
process.  In addition to being logged, a user can associate actions to
an observer.  Examples of observers and actions include:

<ul>

<li> monitor <tt>TestRunner</tt> processes<br>prompt to kill when one
exceeds more than 5 minutes of cpu

<li> monitor <tt>gnome-terminal</tt>, and its children<br> prompt for
the source browser when the program <tt>eclipse</tt> is started.

</ul>

Next is an earlier mock-up of the same window.  Note the time-line
event viewer that is going to eventually added to the above:

Next is a partial mockup (some parts were taken from a snapshot) of
the source view window.  On the left hand side is the stack and variable trace
, and in
the middle the corresponding source.

Finally, given inline code (here <tt>do_something</tt> was inlined),
the source window can display it in place.
