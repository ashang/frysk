This package provides a basic logger mechanism.

<h2>Overview</h2>

The {@link frysk.rsl} package provides the client with a baskc
framework.  The framework is designed to make logging of a programmers
code easy and fast; it is not designed for flexibility.

<h2>Reporting Interface</h2>

The log methods have two general forms, the first for calling from
static methods and the second for calling from dynamic methods.  The
static method looks like:

<pre>
Log.log(String message, ...)
</pre>

and the dynamic method:

<pre>
Log.log(Object self, String message, ...)
</pre>

the logger calls then take alternating message strings and objects;
for instance a typical use looks like:

<pre>
logger.log("myMethod an-arg", arg); // static
logger.log(this, "myMethod an-arg", arg); // dynamic
</pre>

<h2>Output Format</h2>

The log message is displayed blank seperated with specific types
formatted as follows:

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Format</th></tr>
<tr><td>char</td><td>The character in single quotes</td></tr>
<tr><td>int</td><td>Signed Decimal</td></tr>
<tr><td>long</td><td>Unsigned Hexadecimal</td></tr>
<tr><td>Object</td><td>
<table>
<tr><td>Throwable</td><td>The throwable's and all causes's getMessage() wraped in &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</td></tr>
<tr><td>String</td><td>The escaped string (control chars are converted escaped form))</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td><td>The Object's toString() wraped in &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</td></tr></td></tr>
</table></tr>

<tr><td>[]</td><td>The array elements formatted according to above</td></tr>
</table>

for instance:

<pre>
logger.log("int", 1, "long", (long)1, "string", "foo\t");
... int 1 long 0x1 string "foo\t"
</pre>

(notice how casting can be used to select between decimal (int) and
hex (long) specific formats.

<h2>Command Line Option Syntax</h2>

The option parser expects the following syntax:

<pre>
OPTIONS ::= OPTION { "," OPTION }
OPTION ::= LEVEL | PATH | LEVEL "=" PATH
LEVEL ::= "FINE" | "FINEST" | ...
PATH ::= ... path to package or class ...
</pre>

For instance:

<table border=1>
<tr><th>What</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
<tr><td>FINEST</td><td>Set all loggers to FINEST</td></tr>
<tr><td>frysk=FINEST</td><td>Set all frysk loggers to FINEST</td></tr>
<tr><td>frysk</td><td>Set all frysk loggers to the default logging level (FINE)</td></tr>
<tr><td>frysk.expunit.Expect=FINEST</td><td>Set the class, and all its sub-classes, to logging level FINEST</td></tr>
<tr><td>frysk=FINE,inua=FINEST</td><td>Set both the frysk and inua packages logging levels</td></tr>
<tr><td>java.lang.Object=FINE</td><td>Set anything that extends Object's (yes everything) to logging level FINE</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Completer</h2>

A completer is available for command-lines wanting to provide
tab-completion of the known set of loggers.

<h2>Comparison with Existing Loggers</h2>

The following differences between this logger and <tt>log4j</tt>
and <tt>java.util.Logging</tt> are worth noting:

<ul>

<li>class hierarchy is understood; consequently it is possible to
manipulate the logging level of a class hierarchy

<li>logging is lock free (the print object does); consequently the
overhead of a logging call is greatly reduced and the chance of
deadlock is eliminated

<li>creating loggers and setting the log level uses a single global
lock; since these calls occur during class initializaion which is
typically serialized lock contention is not an issue

<li>log calls do not leak memory; for instance, constructs such
as <tt>"{0} arg {1}", new Object[] { this, new Integer(arg) }</tt> are
not necessary (java 5 improves this)

<li>the log interface is more limited; only a specific message call
style and output format is possible

</ul>
