This package exports interfaces to the underlying native linux system.

<h2>Overview</h2>

The {@link frysk.sys} package provides the client with direct access
to a number of underlying linux kernel and <code>libc</code>
interfaces.

<p>

Note that, where possible, the interfaces have attempted to be
event-driven friendly.  For instance, {@link frysk.sys.Wait} notifies
the client of wait status information by calling the applicable {@link
frysk.sys.Wait#Observer} method and not by returning a status object.

<h2>Errors</h2>

Should an underlying system call return an error indication then that
error is propagated up the call chain by throwing a {@link
frysk.sys.Errno} run-time exception.
