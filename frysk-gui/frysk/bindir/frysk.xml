    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para><function>frysk</function> launches the Frysk Execution
    Analsys Tool.</para>

    <para>The goal of the frysk project is to create an intelligent,
    distributed, always-on system monitoring and debugging tool that
    allows developers and system administrators to monitor running
    processes and threads (including creation and destruction events),
    monitor the use of locking primitives, expose deadlocks, gather
    data and debug any given process by either choosing it from a list
    or by accepting frysk's offer to open a source code or other
    window on a process that is in the process of crashing or that has
    been misbehaving in certain user-definable ways. </para>
