	 * using node.setAttribute("someProperty", someProperty);
	 * If this object contains composing @link frysk.gui.monitor.SaveableXXX

	 * to that node. Example:
	 *

	 *      this.filtersList.save(filtersNode);
	 *      node.addContent(filtersNode);
	 *      
	 * Be careful some times one wants to save the objects name rather
	 * than the object itself, and then use the name to later recreate
	 * that object via a managers. Like observers for instance. Perhaps
	 * objects such as these should be smart enough to use a manager to
	 * save/load themselfs, that way an api client doesnt have to worry
