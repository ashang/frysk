This package supplies a wrapper for the Gnome Terminal object used by the 
Frysk Debug Window when it activates processes that require a terminal to
interact with.

<h2>Overview</h2>

The TermWindow object is instantiated whenever a user activates a process from
the Frysk Debug Window and has selected the option to have a terminal window
associated with that process.  The terminal window is where the activated
process' STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR are assigned to so if the process requires input or
needs to output information, it has its own window in which to do so.

The TermWindow object is destroyed if the process if killed or the debug session
is terminated.
