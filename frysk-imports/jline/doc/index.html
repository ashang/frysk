<h1>JLine<blink>_</blink> - 100% pure java console library</h1>
<p>
	JLine is a 100% pure java library for reading and editing
	console input. It is similar in functionality to BSD editline and
	GNU readline. People familiar with the readline/editline
	capabilities for modern shells (such as bash and tcsh) will find
	most of the command editing features of JLine to be familiar.
</p>

<p>
	To run a quick demo of the functionality, download
	<em>jline.jar</em> and <em>jline-demo.jar</em> from
	the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64033"
	>the SourceForge release page</a>, and then run:
</p>
<p>
	<pre>java -jar jline-demo.jar dictionary</pre>
</p>
<p>
	I am interested in hearing which platforms this works for and
	which it does not: please let me know on the
	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=64033&atid=506056"
	>bug page</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The library is currently in beta,
	but basic features like line editing, command history, and
	customizable tab-completion work. See
	the <a href="javadoc">javadoc</a> for usage details, then download
	it <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64033"
	>here</a>. For project details, see the
	<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/jline/">SourceForge
	project page</a>. Simple example usage can be found in the
	<em>jline.example.Example</em> class, included in the source jar.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a more robust and complete console reading library,
	take a look at the
	<a href="http://java-readline.sourceforge.net/">java-readline</a>
	wrapper for the native readline and editline libraries.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Important note:</strong> this library has only been tested 
	on Linux and OSX, and relies on cbreak being turned
	off. The method Terminal.setupTerminal will automatically
	try to issue the appropriate stty commands to set up the console
	correctly. This works well under Linux and Mac OS X. Other UNIX
	platforms are untested. Windows XP is known to have some problems
	with tab-completion, but other line editing functions appear to
	work correctly. Feedback is greatly appreciated.
