	* UnwindCallbacks.java (getProcInfo): Now returns a boolean and takes the
	address of a pre-allocated proc_info object.
	* cni.StackTraceCreator.cxx (find_proc_info): Uses refactored callback and
	correctly passes the struct back to libunwind.
	(unwind_setup): Set caching to UNW_CACHE_PER_THREAD.

	* cni/StackTraceCreator.cxx (get_dyn_info_addr_list): Now sets dilap to 0
	if retval is zero rather than just setting the value it points to to
	zero.

	* RegisterX86.java: Added preamble.
	(getUnwindRegister): Now returns the string name of the register
	for use in getRegisterByName.
	* UnwindException.java: Added preamble.

	* RegisterX86.java: Added.

	* cni/StackTraceCreator.cxx (unwind_setup): Fixed typo.

	* FrameCursor.java (getNext): Renamed to getInner.
	(getPrevious): Renamed to getOuter.
	* cni/StackTraceCreator.cxx (unwind_setup): Changed to reflect updated
	variable names.

	* Frame.java: Renamed to FrameCursor.java.
	(getFuncEndAddr): Removed, should be part of a higher level usage.
	(getFuncStartAddr): Ditto.
	(getFunctionName): Ditto.
	(getPc): Ditto.
	(create_frame): Renamed to create_frame_cursor.
	* StackCreator.java (createStackTrace): Added javadoc comments.
	* cni/Frame.cxx: Renamed to FrameCursor.cxx.
	(create_frame): Renamed to create_frame_cursor, now only memcpy's the
	data in the provided cursor into it's own personal pointer.
	* cni/StackTraceCreator.cxx (unwind_setup): Now links FrameCursors together
	in the correct order (i.e. last->first), so that each frame's "previous"
	frame is the one immediately before it chronologically.
