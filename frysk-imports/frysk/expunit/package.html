This package implements a simplistic version of expect that works with
JUnit.

<h2>Overview</h2>

The {@link frysk.expunit} package provides a collection of methods and
classes that can be used to implement expect based tests within the
JUnit framework.

<h2>Example</h2>

Here is an extract from a simple testcase with running commentry.

<p>
The expect intance is kept in a class variable so that the tear down
code can close it.  This is important as Expect consumes
pseudo-terminal and other resources that must be cleaned up.
<pre>
Expect e;
public void tearDown ()
{
  e.close ();
}
</pre>

The test case proper then starts its program.  Here the program is
<tt>tee</tt> which just copies all of <tt>STDIN</tt> to
<tt>STDOUT</tt>.

<pre>
public void test ()
{
  e = new Expect (new String[] { "/usr/bin/tee" });
</pre>

The <tt>tee</tt> program is then sent some input (the string
"catdogbird"), and then that the string was printed is confirmed.
Several different matches are used, illustrating how partial matches
can occur.

<pre>
  e.send ("catdogbi");
  // skip "cat", match "dog", leaving "bi"
  e.assertExpect (new Regex ("dog"));
  // Append "rd", making "bird"
  e.send ("rd");
  // match that.
  e.assertExpect (new Equals ("bird"));
}
</pre>
