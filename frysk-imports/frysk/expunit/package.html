This package implements a simplistic version of expect that works with
JUnit.

<h2>Overview</h2>

The {@link frysk.expunit} package provides a collection of methods and
classes that can be used to implement expect based tests within the
JUnit framework.

<h2>Example One - simple matching</h2>

Here is an extract from a simple testcase with running commentry.

<p>
The expect intance is kept in a class variable so that the tear down
code can close it.  This is important as Expect consumes
pseudo-terminal and other resources that must be cleaned up.
<pre>
Expect e;
public void tearDown ()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;e.close ();
}
</pre>

The test case proper then starts its program.  Here the program is
<tt>tee</tt> which just copies all of <tt>STDIN</tt> to
<tt>STDOUT</tt>.

<pre>
public void test ()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;// Create an instance of expect running "tee"
&nbsp;&nbsp;e = new Expect ("tee");
</pre>

The <tt>tee</tt> program is then sent some input (the strings
"catchthebi" and "rd"), and then the string was printed is checked.
Several different matches are used, illustrating how partial matches
can occur.

<pre>
e.send ("catchthebi");
// Skip "catch", match "the", leaving "bi".
e.assertExpect ("the");
// Append "rd", making "bird".
e.send ("rd");
// Match  the "bird".
e.assertExpect ("bird");
</pre>

<h2>Example Two - Interacting with a shell</h2>

This example illustrates two things:

<ul>

<li>How to interact with a shell such as bash; in particular anchoring
each pattern with the shell's prompt</li>

<li>Taking different actions according to what was matched.</li>

</ul>

<pre>
// Create the shell, as sh
e = new Expect (new String[] { "/bin/sh" });
// Match the initial prompt.  This ensures that things are
// blocked until the shell is fully running.  As a side effect
// it also discards all output so far.
e.assertExpect ("\\$ ");
// Send a command to simplify the prompt, and then match it.
// Notice how the matching pattern includes the
// carrage-return, the new-line, and the promt.  That ensures
// that it doesn't accidently match the command.
e.send ("PS1='\\$ '\r");
e.assertExpect ("\r\n\\$ ");
// Check out the terminal, again be careful to match the
// prompt.
e.send ("stty -a\r");
final StringBuffer g = new StringBuffer ();
e.assertExpect (new Match[]
&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;new Regex ("\\s(-brkint)\\s.*\\$ ")
&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void execute ()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.append (group (1));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;new Regex ("\\s(brkint)\\s.*\\$ ")
&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void execute ()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.append (group (1));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;});
assertEquals ("brk mode", "-brkint", g.toString ());
</pre>
