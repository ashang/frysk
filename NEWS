Frysk is an execution-analysis technology being developed using Java
and C++.  It is aimed at providing developers and system
administrators with the ability to examine and analyze multi-host,
multi-process, and multi-threaded systems while they are running.


Release 0.2, 2008-04-02:

This initial release of frysk includes:

-> command line utilities:

   fauxv - print the auxiliary vector (new)
   fcatch - catch and print the stack of a crashing process
   fcore - extract a core file from a running process (faster, more correct)
   fdebuginfo - list debug-info requirements of a process (new)
   fdebugrpm - install debug-info requirements of a process (new)
   ferror - catch and back-trace error calls (new)
   fexe - print the executable path
   fmaps - print the address map (new)
   fstack - print each thread's stack (supports in-line back-traces)
   fstep - single-step a process
   ftrace - trace a processes system and (new) library calls

   Known limitations: large resident set size; large executable size.

-> Prototype command line debugger: fhpd

   For single threaded programs, FHPD can: print the value, type, and
   location, and modify the value of, arbitrarily located variable
   (complex DWARF location expressions); correctly handle very-large
   integers (>64-bit) and large floats (80-bit); display in-line
   information in back-traces; control processes with the commands
   load, core, dump, run, step, break, go, detach, kill, list, focus.

   In addition to the command-line utility restrictions, the HPD has
   the following known limitations: disassembler missing; limited
   type-cast support in expressions; limited multi-thread support.

-> Prototype visual debugging and monitoring tool (frysk)

   Known limitations: work-flow limited to live processes (examining
   core files, or creating processes is possible but very
   non-intuitive).

-> Prototype test-suite (funit)

   Known limitations: test that are working in-tree fail when
   installed.
