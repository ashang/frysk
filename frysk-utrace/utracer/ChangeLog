	* Makefile: Added utracer/utracer-errmsgs.h to dependencies.
	* udb-text-ui.c: Added PID selector to printreg and printregall
	cmds. Stored invalid commands on readline history stack for editing.

Tue Jul  3 11:10:11 2007  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* udb-text-ui.c: Added hash table for syscall names.  Added parser
	for syscall filte commands.  Fixed several cmds to accept
	current_pid if no pid argument supplied.

	* udb-response.c:  Added code to display report_exec results
	(i.e., the name of the binary file execed.)

Fri Jun 29 23:04:02 2007  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* udb-i386.c: New source file containing i386-specific code
	* udb.c: Added a capability to pass arguments with pgms to be
	loaded and, optionally, run.  (Note that this doesn't provide
	globbing, parm expansion, or any of that shell stuff, but passing,
	e.g., "ls -1" does what you expect.)

Fri Jun 29 21:40:04 2007  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* udb-i386.h: Added a local copy of the struct pt_regs decl--the
	one in /usr/include/asm/ptrace.h doesn't match the one in
	<kernel>/include/asm/ptrace.h. The local copy is from the kernel
	header. Added a table of syscall name strings derived from
	<kernel>/include/asm-i386/unistd.h. 

Fri Jun 29 12:05:34 2007  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* Makefile: Added udb-i386.c and tweaked dependencies
	* udb-i386.h: Moved i386_signals from udb-response.c.
	* udb-i386.c: New source file to handle i386-specific stuff.
	* udb-response.c: Removed i386_signals to udb-i386.h and added
	support for syscall data.
	
Thu Jun 28 23:30:55 2007  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* udb-utrace-if.c: Added support for selectively execing a pgm and
	immediately quiescing it, or execing it and running it.
	* udb.c: Same as above.

Thu Jun 28 10:41:46 2007  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* OVERVIEW: Added to provide of utracer and udb.
	* udb-response.c: Added by separating it out of udb.c.  Provides
	the response entry listener.
	* udb-i386.h: Added by separating i386-specific stuff from other
	sources.
	* udb-text-ui.c: Added a switchpid command to verify that the
	specified PID exists, then switch to it if it does.
	* udb.c: Added support for forking/attaching/execing a
	command-line specified program.

Wed Jun 27 23:27:03 2007  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* udb-text-ui.c: Added a printregall command to print all
	available register values.
	* udb.c: Added display capability for the printregall cmd.

Wed Jun 27 21:33:01 2007  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* udb-text-ui.c: Added a means of listing all attached processes.
	Added a means of attaching to a process without quiescing it.
	Added a little help for supported commands.
	* udb-utrace-if.c: Added support for a means of attaching to a
	process without quiescing it.  Added support for a means of
	listing all attached processes.
	* udb.c: Added a pthread_join() to wait for the listener thread to
	die after pthread_cancel().  (The absence of the join was
	interfering with module unloading.)  Added a text description of
	received signals.   Added support for a means of listing all
	attached processes.  Added support for death and exit reporting.
	Added support for a "-w" option that watches (attaches without
	quiescing) specified processes.

	* udb-text-ui.c: Added descriptions to CLI commands.

2007-06-19  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* udb-module.c: New--moved the module loading/unloading code here

	use" problems.

	Added a response parser/formatter to the listener thread.  Added a

	* udb.h: Patch to accomdate the above.
