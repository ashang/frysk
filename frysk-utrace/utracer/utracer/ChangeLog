	* utracer-if-io.c:
	* utracer.h: Added controls to enable, disable, and filter

	client.

	* utracer.h:  Added support for syscall reports.

Thu Jun 28 23:34:32 2007  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* utracer-base.c: Added support for selectively execing a pgm and
	immediately quiescing it, or execing it and running it.

	* utracer-if-io.c: Fixed fork/attach/exec--it forks, attaches, and
	execs, then quiesces.  (Note to self:  add option to not quiesce for
	report_syscall_* and other on-the-fly monitoring.)

	* utracer-if-io.c: Added support for the switchpid command.
	* utracer.h: Added support for the switchpid command.

	size to responses (e.g., the list of attached PIDs).  Adding
	support for death and exit reporting.  Added support for attaching
	without quiescing.  Added support for listing attached processes.
	Fixed if_file_read().  (Note to self: check for negative array
	indices /before/ spending two days wondering how a simple wait
	queue can blow up a kernel.)
	* utracer.h: Add support for all the above.

Wed Jun 19 23:25:20 2007  Chris Moller  <cmoller@redhat.com>

	* utracer-if-io.c: Added responses for report_exit and
	report_death.  Added a passive attach (Attaches a process but
	doesn't quiesce it.).
	* utracer.h:  Patched to accomdate the above.

2007-06-18  Chris Moller  <moller@mollerware.com>

	* utracer-base.c: Separated the single utraced-specific if_cmd
	file into a write-only cmd file and a read-only response file.
	* utracer-cf-io.c: Patched to accomodate above.  Cleaned up
	diagnostic code.
	* utracer-if-io.c: Added a wait queue to the if_resp fcn to block
	until data is ready, allowing the userspace debugger to select() on
	input from the LKM.  Cleaned up diagnostic code.  Added a wait
	queue to make sure queued data isn't overwritten.  Added responses
	for clone and signal asynchronous events.  Added response for
	attach cmd.
	* utracer-private.h: Patched to accomdate the above.  

2007-06-15  Chris Moller  <moller@mollerware.com>

	debugging client to watch for the death of the client.
	* utracer-if-io.c: Added the LKM end of the asynchronous client
	notification testcase stuff (signal injection).
	* utracer.h: Added support for the async stuff.
