	* utracer-base.c: Separated the single utraced-specific if_cmd
	file into a write-only cmd file and a read-only response file.
	* utracer-cf-io.c: Patched to accomodate above.  Cleaned up
	diagnostic code.
	* utracer-if-io.c: Added a wait queue to the if_resp fcn to block

	input from the LKM.  Cleaned up diagnostic code.  Added a wait
	queue to make sure queued data isn't overwritten.  Added responses
	for clone and signal asynchronous events.  Added response for
	attach cmd.
