	* include:
	* module:  Added two new dirs and moved the "public" headers to
	the include dir and everything else to the module dir.  This is in
	aid of coupling the user-space end of the read, write, and ioctl
	ops more closely to the module (instead of to the front-end) in
	preparation for writing a Java wrapper.

	synchronisation stuff.
	* utracer-if-io.c: More synchronisation stuff.  Added stuff trying

	size to responses (e.g., the list of attached PIDs).  Adding
	support for death and exit reporting.  Added support for attaching
	without quiescing.  Added support for listing attached processes.

	input from the LKM.  Cleaned up diagnostic code.  Added a wait
	queue to make sure queued data isn't overwritten.  Added responses
	for clone and signal asynchronous events.  Added response for
	attach cmd.
