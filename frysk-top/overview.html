An overview of the <em>frysk</em> Execution Analysis Technology.

<h2>Overview</h2>

At a high level, <em>frysk</em>'s architecture can be viewed as a
collection of clients that interact with <em>frysk</em>'s core.
<em>frysk</em>'s core providing clients with alternate models of the
system.

<p>

<em>frysk</em> then uses the target system's kernel interfaces to
maintain its internal models.

<p>

Each of the components that make up <em>frysk</em> are discussed
below.

<h2><em>frysk</em>'s Core</h2>

<h3>A Layered Architecture</h3>

An application running on a linux system can modeled at several
different levels, each level providing a different of abstraction.
For instance a distributed application, consisting of multiple
processes and threads, running across multiple physical machines can
be viewed, or modeled, as:

<ul>

<li>
A shared-memory multi-processor executing machine instructions on a
local machine.

<li>
A multi-threaded program written in <sc>C</sc> and using
<sc>POSIX</sc> threads.

<li>
A distributed application, made up of a number of programs distributed
across multiple machines.

</ul>

<br>

Each level of abstraction (or model) being implemented using the
layers below.

<p>

This can be depicted visually as:

<p>

This structure is characterized as <cite>The Layered
Architecture</cite>, and key benefits and characteristics of this
architecture include:

<p>
Benefits:

<ul>
<li>
Segmentation of high-level from low-level issues.
<li>
The implementation details of a layer are hidden (abstracted) from
other layers.
<li>
Many upper layers can share the services of a lower layer.
</ul>

<p>
Dynamics:

<ul>
<li>
Requests percolate downward between layers.
<li>
Notifications percolate upward between layers.
<li>
Layers can improve performance by caching requests.
</ul>

<p>

In addition, a layered architecture, permits the distribution of
components across a network.  For instance, in the case of a cluster,
and dependent on the performance requirements, one or more components
may be local or remote:

<p>

For further discussion of layered architectures, see <a
href="http://www.stevenblack.com/PTN-Layers.asp">Layered
Architecture</a>.

<h3>Kernel Interface</h3>

At the lowest level, is <em>frysk</em>'s interface to underlying operating
system (or kernel).  The interface is implemented using {@link
frysk.sys}, kernel level events as they arrive, being managed using
{@link frysk.event} (<em>frysk</em>'s event loop).

<p>

For instance, when implementing single-step, the kernel will generate
stop events as illustrated by:

<p>

For further information, see {@link frysk.sys}, and {@link
frysk.event}.

<h3>Process Model</h3>

The Linux Process Layer abstracts the Kernel
Layer, multi-processor machine in more exacting details.  This
abstraction models individual registers, the program-counter, and
hardware breakpoints and watchpoints.  It also implements more complex
operations such as step-out-of-range (implemented using lower-level
primitives).

<p>

See {@link frysk.proc}, for more information.

<h3>Language Model</h3>

The language model provides a source-language view of the running
application.  The model includes abstractions for high-level language
concepts such as thread, frame and variable.

<p>

High level language support is implemented within this layer.

<p>

See {@link frysk.lang}, for more information.

<h3>Application Model</h3>

For an application distributed across multiple nodes of a cluster,
there is an additional Cluster Layer, providing an overriding model of
the system being debugged.

<h2>Command Line Interpreter</h2>

Built into <em>frysk</em> is a command line interpreter based on the
specification published by the High Performance Debugger Forum.

<p>

Additional interpreters (such as <code>adb</code>), and scripting
languages (such as <code>scheme</code> and <code>Python</code>) may be
added at some stage in the future.

<p>

See {@link frysk.cli.hpd} for more information in <em>frysk</em>'s existing
interpreter.

<h2>Clients</h2>

<h3>GUI</h3>

See {@link frysk.gui} for a more detailed description of <em>frysk</em>'s
graphical interface.

<h3>Command Line Utilities</h3>

Frysk includes a number of command line utilities, at present they
include: {@link frysk.bin.ftrace} to trace the system calls of running
processes, {@link frysk.bin.fstack} to print the current stack of a
running process.  These utilities are implemented by directly
interacting with <em>frysk</em>'s process model:

<p>

In the future, a stand-alone command-line tool, that provides a
wrapper around <em>frysk</em>'s built in High Performance Debugger
Interpreter, or more traditional debugger interface (such as
<code>adb</code>) may be added.  For the moment, that interface is
only available via the GUI.

<h3>Eclipse</h3>

There are many ways that Eclipse can exploit <em>frysk</em>.  For
instance, by using <code>libgcj_db</code> library, along with
knowledge of the internals of a Java Virtual Machine (<sc>JVM</sc>)
running within a process, an abstract model of a Java Virtual Machine
can then be constructed.  That model being exported to Eclipse using
the Java Debug Wire Protocol (<sc>JDWP</sc>).
